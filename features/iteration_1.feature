Feature: Address labels
  As a company that sells goods
  I want to send catalogs to potential customers
  So that they'll remember us and maybe impulse-buy something

  Scenario: Format labels
    Given the comma-separated address
      """
      Baldwin,Michael,Mr.,123 Simple Ct.
      """
    When it is formatted for display
    Then it looks like
      """
      Mr. Michael Baldwin
      123 Simple Ct.
      """
