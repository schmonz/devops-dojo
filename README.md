# DevOps Dojo

This repository supports an interactive workshop created by Lisa Crispin and Amitai Schleier for Agile Roots 2015 (and facilitated by Amitai several times since).

If you'd like to use these materials to run your own workshop, you're (1) welcome to and (2) in the right place!


## The Purpose

DevOps is [two things](https://schmonz.com/2016/11/23/automation-for-web-hosting/).
This workshop does not cover automation. It's about collaboration.


## The Story

Our business is an old-school retailer.
We need to send catalogs to customers.
So Development developed a program to print address labels.
When it's time to mail out another batch, Operations operates the program on the latest customer database.

Dev is Dev, and Ops is Ops.
We don't think there's any point in having them work together.
