## Preparation

We provide a pre-cooked Perl/Ruby/whatever program that prints
"address labels".

Helpful info for preparing our data:

- [Recurring characters from Flying Circus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recurring_Monty_Python's_Flying_Circus_characters)
- [Category: Monty Python characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Monty_Python_characters)

## Start

Here's some (totally vanilla, but Monty Python-themed) data. Try
printing the labels. Anyone need help running the program? See how
it looks when it's working right?

## A new feature

Okay, now the (Monty Python-themed) customer needs a new feature.
Don't worry, we're not asking you to figure out how to implement
it. Here (on the big screen) is the change the Devs should type in
to implement the feature. Devs, does it run and look right to you?

## Ship it

Ops, here's the real data (with new weird kinds of names). Please
print the labels. Ooooooooops, they don't look right, do they.

## Oooops

Devs, you didn't have that data, but you do own this code. Ops, you
don't own this code, but you did allow it into production. That was
a waste of company money and could have been worse (damaged our
reputation...). You're not in trouble, but yeah, you're sort of in
trouble. Let's not have this happen again.

## A new bugfixing

Devs, here are the changes you should type in to fix the formatting
errors we just saw. Run it on the new data to see that it formats
correctly. Yeah? Cool.

## Ship it

Ops, here's some slightly updated data. Please run the labels again.
Ooooooooooooooooops.

## Ooooops again

Devs, ops, we asked you to not have this happen again, but it did.
Maybe that's because we didn't change anything about how the work
works. Should we? What would you suggest we change?
